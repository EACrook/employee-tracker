# Employee Tracker
Node.js application for employee tracking.

## Description
This application utilizes inquirerer and Node.js to keep track of a companies employees. Right now functionality includes viewing all employees, departments, roles, and salaries for the roles; adding new employees, departments, and roles; and updating an employee's role.

## Future Development
I am hoping to be able to update employee managers, view employees by manager, view employees by department, and add deletion functionality to this application in the future. It would also be fun to add front end functionality to this code base as well.
